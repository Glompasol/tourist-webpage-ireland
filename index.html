  <h3>The History of Ireland</h3>
  <p>
    Ireland's story is one of resilience and endurance, and even in tough times the Irish have always found a way to celebrate life whether its through music, dance, or a good pint of Guinness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before Christianity, the Celtic people lived in Ireland. Consisting of many different tribes, the Celtic people were known for being warriors, like the Vikings who later invaded Ireland in the 8th century and established settlements. These viking camps would go on to become Ireland's largest coastal cities including Dublin, its capital.
  </p>
  <p>

    In 1155 the normans invaded Ireland marking the start of a 800 year period of British rule. Ireland under British rule often found itself involved in conflicts such as the wars of the three kingdoms which resulted in more than 220 000 Irish deaths. Furthermore Ireland had numerous famines but the most devastating was the great famine of 1845 which killed more than one million people and forced another million to emigrate taking away 1/4 of the population.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/Hogan's_Flying_Column.png" alt="United Ireland supporter hanged" class="big-wiki-float-img">
    In the 20th century the Irish would see a surge of nationalism and a desire for independence with the Easter rising of 1916. Although the rising was quickly crushed this would inspire many to join the fight and initiated the Irish war of independence from 1919-1921 and would force the british to create a treaty giving Ireland dominion status. However this would lead to the Irish civil war between those who supported the treaty and those who opposed it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/the_troubles.png" alt="The Troubles" class="big-wiki-float-img">
    In the 1960's tensions between the Protestant majority and the Catholic minority would rise after a campaign by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association to end discrimination against the Catholic minority by the Protestants. 
    The government would attempt to suppress these protests with the police The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), that were overwhelmingly Protestant and known for police brutality particularly against Catholics. Increasing tensions led to the deployment of British troops in Northern Ireland in what would become the British army's longest operation.
    The British were initially welcomed by some catholics being seen as a peacekeeping force but that trust would quickly dissolve after the Bloody Sunday Massacre in 1972. 
    The main participants in the Troubles were the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).
    The Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA) was the most active paramilitary group throughout the Troubles. The Provisional IRA sought to end British Rule in Northern Ireland and facilitate Irish reunification and proclaimed themselves as the sole legitimate successor to the original IRA from the Irish War Of Independence.
